# Sakila Api
> The purpose of this project is to build an API (REST - SOAP) for the Sakila Sample Database in MySQL. The goal of the API is to provide a simple and easy-to-use interface for accessing and managing the data stored in the Sakila database. The API will allow users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on various tables in the database, such as customer, film, inventory, actor, and more.


## Overview:
> Sakila is a sample database for MySQL that is commonly used for testing and learning purposes. It includes a fictional DVD rental store scenario with a database schema that contains various tables, such as customer, film, inventory, and payment, among others.
  * Many to many relationships
  * Primary keys are called [tablename]_[id]
  * Foreign keys are called like their referenced primary key, if possible. This allows for using JOIN .. USING syntax where supported

## Usage

## ```SOAP```
> This SOAP API only accepts HTTP POST requests but it also supports several common operations for all item types, including Add, Delete, Load, and Update. Youâ€™ll see these operations instead of the HTTP verbs GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.

You can use postman to use this API or bulid your client application and then import wsdl.

[SOAP WSDL](https://github.com/rahmamustafa/Sakila-Api/tree/main/SOAP%20wsdl)

## ```REST```
> REST requests are HTTP requests made to the the endpoint URL of Sakila REST API, which has the following format: http://{your-server}:{port-number}/sakila/api/{resource}s/. This API uses the HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
All subsequent requests the user-agent may make are discovered inside the response to each request. The media types used for these representations, and the link relations they may contain, are part of the API.

## Run Locally

  Download the Sakila database  
  1. You can download the Sakila sample database from 
[Sakila Database](https://downloads.mysql.com/docs/sakila-db.zip)

> The Zip file contains three files: sakila-schema.sql, sakila-data.sql and sakila.mwb.

 * ```sakila-schema.sql:``` The file contains all CREATE statements to create the structure of the Sakila database, including tables, views, stored procedures, functions and triggers.
 * ```sakila-data.sql:``` The file contains all INSERT statements to insert data.
 * ```sakila.mwb:``` The file is a MySQL Workbench data model. You can open it in MySQL Workbench to check the database structure.
 2. Unzip the downloaded zip file to a temporary location for example C:\temp\. It creates a folder named sakila-db that contains sakila-schema.sql and sakila-data.sql files.
 3. Execute sakila-schema.sql to create the database structure and execute sakila-data.sql to insert the data into the database, by using the following command:
   
   ```bash
   mysql> SOURCE C:/temp/sakila-db/sakila-schema.sql;
   mysql> SOURCE C:/temp/sakila-db/sakila-data.sql;
```
   
  4. Clone the repositary
   ```bash 
     git clone https://github.com/rahmamustafa/Sakila-Api.git
   ```
  5. Change database user and password to yours in persistence.xml file
   
  6. Finally, to run the project run command
  ```bash
    mvn clean install tomcat7:deploy
```
